<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4> Handling Docker Errors </h4>

When encountering issues with creating or running containers due to old volumes that could not be deleted properly, try running the following commands:

1- List the existing Docker volumes using the following command: 
docker volume ls

2- Before deleting the old volumes, stop the container(s) using the following command:
docker-compose down

3- Remove the all the old volumes using the following command:
docker volume prune 

Options may be added to this last command:

--filter filter : Provide filter values (e.g. 'label=<label>')
--force , -f    : Do not prompt for confirmation

If the response indicated "Total reclaimed space: 0B" and the old volumes are not removed as expected, try restarting docker.

<h4> Handling "Request Timed Out" Error </h4>

During the tutorials, the error message "request timed out" could be sometimes encountered when making HTTP requests.
This error typically occurs when the HTTP client is unable to receive a response from the server within a specified time limit. 
One common cause of this issue is a slow network connection. In this case, try the following solutions:

- Retry the request because the timeout may be temporary due to network fluctuations.
- Check the network connection.
