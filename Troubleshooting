  This Section adresses issues that Windows 11 users may encounter during the tutorials. It provides also a step-by-step solutions to help overcome
  any roadblocks and to ensure a smooth experience when running the tutorials.
    

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

## Handling Docker Errors

When encountering issues with creating or running containers due to old volumes that could not be deleted properly, try running the following commands:

1- List the existing Docker volumes using the following command: 
docker volume ls

2- Before deleting the old volumes, stop the container(s) using the following command:
docker-compose down

3- Remove the all the old volumes using the following command:
docker volume prune 

Options may be added to this last command:
--filter filter : Provide filter values (e.g. 'label=<label>')
--force , -f    : Do not prompt for confirmation

If the response indicated "Total reclaimed space: 0B" and the old volumes are not removed as expected, try restarting docker.

## Handling "Request Timed Out" Error

During the tutorials, the error message "request timed out" could be sometimes encountered when making HTTP requests. This error typically occurs when the HTTP client is unable to receive a response from the server within a specified time limit. One common cause of this issue is a slow network connection. In this case, try the following solutions:

- Retry the request because the timeout may be temporary due to network fluctuations.
- Check the network connection.
