  description: |
      This entity contains a harmonised description of a Building. This entity is associated with the vertical segments of smart homes, smart cities, industry and related IoT applications.
      This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/), compared to GSMA data model following changes are introduced:
      -   the reference to `BuildingType` is removed, since `BuildingType` compared to
          `category` attribute does not introduce significant information.
      
      -   `category` attribute is required.
      -   `openingHours` is introduced following schema.org data model to allow
          fine-grained on building opening times. GSMA supported this as free text in
          the `notes` attribute (removed as well).
      
      -   `refSubscriptionService` is not supported, since `SubscriptionService` model
          is not supported currently.
